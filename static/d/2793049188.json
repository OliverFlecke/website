First, a tool to simulate the robots and their environment is created, which allows for various layouts and scenarios. A design for a MAS is discussed, focusing on communication between agents, how plans can be constructed, and an algorithm for solving the Multi-Agent Path-Finding problem. A variation adding weights to edges in the search graph is proposed, which helps minimize conflicts. The MAS is evaluated based on the simulation tool, using warehouse environments as a case study. This shows that the MAS is able to handle dynamic objects in an environment and scale up to many robots.","date":"2019-07-18","pageCount":74,"downloadPath":"publications/Multi-Agent Systems and Planning with MiR.pdf"}},{"node":{"id":"6c1ffdd1-da22-5a85-a1a5-a5af17b106c2 >>> pdf","title":"Multi-Agent Systems","author":"Helge Hatteland s144457, Oliver Fleckenstein s144472","abstract":"IMM-B.Sc-2017-????","date":null,"pageCount":134,"downloadPath":"publications/Bachelor Thesis - Multi-Agent Systems.pdf"}}]}}}
